Rere Rock Slide has been included in the NZ Automobile Association's 101 Must-do places for Kiwis.[1] It is a smooth, natural rock formation 60 metres (200 ft) long, at an angle of about 30Â°, over which the Wharekopae River rushes like water in a giant water slide. It can be slid down on boogie boards or tyres. -Wikipedia
